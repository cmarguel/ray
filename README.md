# ray

This is a very bare bones raytracer built in Go. It was mainly done as a learning project so that I could try out the Go language while learning more about graphics. 

I have a story.txt file which documents the order in which I added features, if anyone wants to learn from it. However, please do not attempt to use this for any real project! It doesn't support colored materials, and I'm pretty sure the scene parser is still broken!
